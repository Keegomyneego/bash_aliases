# bash_aliases
A simple collection of bash profiles that provide basic aliases and a nice git-centric prompt

# git-completion
Some of these files depend on git-completion.bash and git-prompt.sh from git's source code. Instead of adding a rather large and unnecessary submodule to this project, I just wrote a simple script to curl the 2 files to this directory :)
